/**
 * Created by theif519 on 12/5/2015.
 * <p/>
 * This is the proof-of-concept for the upcoming Mac OS X style menus. Right now, whenever a ACTION_DOWN
 * event occurs in any of this layout's children, it will broadcast the name of layout, which in this case,
 * is the name of the FloatingFragment.
 * <p/>
 * So imagine instead of a string, instead it sends it's own custom Menu hierarchy. This would allow me to
 * just broadcast it (Imagine how impossible this would be with a normal BroadcastReceiver, or how rather how tightly
 * coupled everything would be. I would have to keep a weak reference to the activity and it's call it's method
 * to set the current menu, OR I would have to somehow serialize the entire view (FYI, View
 * does not implement Parcelable, and that's MUCH slower than just sending the object through RxBus)
 * and have it set it that way, etc.) and allow whatever activity/fragment/class to handle removing
 * the old view and adding the new one, etc.
