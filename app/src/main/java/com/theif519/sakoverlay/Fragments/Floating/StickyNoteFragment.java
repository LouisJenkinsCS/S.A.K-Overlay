/**
 * Created by theif519 on 10/31/2015.
 * <p/>
 * Right now Sticky Note is more of a filler. It serializes/saves the user's content, but unless you create
 * more than one of them, they will not be saved, nor can they be saved meaningfully, and since there is a
 * bug right now, the persistence of such notes are volatile. However, as stated before, it is very
 * proof of concept. It is the only FloatingFragment subclass thus far to serialize it's own data, and it
 * also looks pretty. What can I say? It's a demo.
 * <p/>
 * In the future, Sticky Note will become NotePad, a personalized note-tasking assistant. It will be
 * able to do the following...
 * <p/>
 * 1) Open up txt, .md, .json, .log, etc. files. It will not support proprietary formats, like .pdf
 * and .docx. LazyInflater, whenever that gets implemented, may allow other people to create their own,
 * if this app kicks off well enough.
 * <p/>
 * 2) Be able to save any data, and preferably have syntax highlighting. Yup, you guessed it, Notepad will have
 * programming syntax. Who would of thought?
 * <p/>
 * 3) Tabs. The ability to have more than one at any given time, separated in a tab view, or whatever it is called.
 * This is actually very easily doable. I just do not have the time. Finals and all that.
