/**
 * Created by theif519 on 10/29/2015.
 * <p/>
 * This is the base and core class for FloatingFragments. A FloatingFragment is what it sounds like, it is
 * a Fragment which acts as if it is attached to a container, I.E Floating. It is bounded within the walls
 * of the main_layout container (beginning of action bar, edges of screen, and the task bar at the bottom
 * however it can be moved at will by the user.
 * <p/>
 * FloatingFragments contain their own custom life cycle methods, handle serializing and deserializing their views,
 * as well as unpacking and setting themselves up. Although the presentation I gave already described how
 * everything works, I will summarize it once again here...
 * <p/>
 * The custom life-cycles reflect the MainActivity's life cycles and are also triggered by them.
 * <p/><pre>
 * MainActivity methods preceded with a (-)
 * FloatingFragments methods preceded with a (+)
 * FloatingFragments custom lifecycle methods preceded with a (~)
 * - OnCreate()
 *  - DeserializeFloatingFragments()
 *      + OnCreateView()
 *          ~ Unpack()
 *              // Will be called if mappedContext passed, as in, if instantiated from the deserializer factory.
 *  ~ Setup()
 *      + OnDestroy()
 *          ~ CleanUp()
 * - OnPause()
 *  - SerializeFloatingFragments()
 *      ~ Serialize()
 *          // Where each FloatingFragment serializes their data.
 * </pre><p/>
 * <p/>
 * Relatively simplistic flow. Some life cycle methods may be changed or outright removed later (I.E CleanUp)
 * however as of now they remain.
 * <p/>
 * It should be noted that I removed the Rx and multithreading from the onTouch events, as while IMO they
 * sounded like a great and cool idea, and they did actually work at first, it was only because of a really
 * big mistake I made by instantiating a new LayoutParam each time I called resize() or snap(), which is surprisingly
 * often (Seems that ACTION_UP gets called more than once a lot of the time). I found this out by checking out
 * Allocation Tracker and seeing that after 5 minutes of use, it had allocated it (which is 64 bytes of memory
 * in size) over a 1,000 times. Even though the VM cleaned it up, it still would have caused the GC to trigger a LOT.
