 * Created by theif519 on 11/13/2015.
 * <p/>
 * This file, inspired by that guy who went last on Thursday of the first week (forgot his name, but not his work), is used
 * to keep track of all global constants which are generic enough for other classes to reuse. It is used
 * to keep an organized track of all variables which are considered global, and/or reusable enough that
 * other classes may also utilize them. Not all constants go here, certain ones (I.E FloatingFragment and it's
 * subclasses IDENTIFIER variable) would create conflicts if they were all accessed here.
 * <p/>
 * Globals are organized, insofar, by Keys (for key-value pairs) and miscallaneous others. Keys, as of yet,
 * are split between normal Keys, and Options, both explained below.
