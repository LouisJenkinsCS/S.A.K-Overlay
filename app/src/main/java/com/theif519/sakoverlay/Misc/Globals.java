/**
 * Created by theif519 on 11/13/2015.
 * <p/>
 * This file, inspired by that guy who went last on Thursday (forgot his name, but not his work), is used
 * to keep track of all global constants which are generic enough for other classes to reuse. It should be noted,
 * once again, only ones which are GENERIC are reused. Hence, ones which each class has a specificified value,
 * even if they have the same name (I.E FloatingFragment subclasses IDENTIFIER constant is different for each subclass).
 * <p/>
 * Global has two roots in the hierarchy, "Mutable" and "Immutable".
 * <p/>
 * Global.Mutable contains globals which can be changed, while Global.Immutable cannot be changed after their declaration.
 * Both are thread-safe.
 * <p/>
 * The overall layout looks like this
 * Globals
 * |->  Immutable
 * |-> Numbers
 * |-> Enumerations
 * |-> Strings
 * |->  Mutable
 * |-> Numbers
 * |-> Enumerations
 * |-> Strings
 * <p/>
 * Hence, while accessing these globals may feel arduous, especially if you do not include the entire package, I.E
 * <p/>
 * com.theif519.sakoverlay.misc.Globals.Immutable.Enumerations.RecorderState
 * <p/>
 * Now that, is a mouthful. However, of course, this can be remedied by importing the Globals package,
 * reducing it to...
 * <p/>
 * Globals.Immutable.Enumerations.RecorderState
 * <p/>
 * Long-Winded, however, it will allow me to add as many constants as I want and allow it to be easily
 * managed in the long-run.
