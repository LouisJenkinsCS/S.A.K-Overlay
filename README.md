# S.A.K-Overlay

## What is it?

S.A.K-Overlay is the brand new, unique and original Window Manager for Android. A Window Manager, in this sense, is a container which allows the dynamic placement of Widgets to the user's specifications. While this definition may differ from the conventional meaning, it maintains the central philosophy in mind.

S.A.K-Overlay allows the user to place custom-made Widgets wherever they may please, and is persistent in that they are maintained across user-sessions. S.A.K-Overlay will soon allow the user to create their own custom Widgets via our Drag-and-Drop tools, which will allow the user to create a Widget Layout from scratch to be inflated later. This means you can create your own mini-apps within S.A.K-Overlay without any prior programming experience. Code can be similated through our Callback Generator, which will support operations which effect other user-aligned Widget Views (created inside the Widget Layout), or even effect Widgets outside of the Widget Layout (I.E, pre-made Widgets, or launching another app). This feature is far off from completion, but is steadily getting there,and will be one of the defining features of this application.

S.A.K-Overlay also will soon allow the user to place homescreen widgets as well, allowing S.A.K-Overlay to act as a second, more portable Homescreen.

To summarize, this will allow the user to align and place (or even Snap) Widgets, either pre-made, user-created, or homescreen, wherever they please. The ability to detach (Remove from central container, add to WindowManager) the Widget from the overlay will also be created soon.

### Window Manager

#### Widgets

Comes with already created and configured, convenient widgets.

##### Web Browser

* Minimal web browser
* Basic navigation of history

##### Sticky Note

* Write notes
* Persistent

##### Google Maps

* Shows current location and address

##### Screen Recorder

* Records the screen
* Can be controlled through a "floating" controller (Play/Stop button)

##### Custom

Allows the creation of your own personal Widgets, allowing the user to use our Drag-and-Drop tools as a WYSIWYG layout creation tool, as well allowing more minimial and simple callbacks functions which allows the user to interract with other componenets of the layout, other layouts, or even other other applications, aptly named the Callback Generator.

#### Move & Resize

Allows you, the user, to move and adjust Widgets wherever and however you want. Widgets are preserved across sessions and recreated if needed to be exactly where you placed them. Snap Widgets to sides of the screen or corners, maximize or minimize them, all of the power is at your finger tips.

##### Not Just Inside The Overlay

The ability to "detatch" the Widget will also be made possible, allowing users to not only create their own Widgets, but have it exist outside of the Overlay. This process is done by removing it from the Overlay and adding it to Android's own WindowManager. 

#### Multitasking

Allows the user to not only launch Widgets, it also allows the user to manage multiple of them, leading to a more natural multitasking experience. They can be aligned however you please to further promote productivity, and is transparent so as to help ensure that application it is overlaying does not killed by the Android Out-Of-Memory manager.

#### Gaming

The Window Manager originally was created with gaming in mind, and although now is more general-use, gaming still is a key selling feature of this application.

##### Philosophy

Bring up the overlay in-game, browse the web, write down notes, or just plain do what your custom-made Widget was made to do. The overlay attempts to minimize itself and keep the background application visible at all times to ensure it is not killed off by Android's memory manager. 

### Pricing

Free. For the price of absolutely nothing, all of the following features are offered, as well as lifetime support from the Developer himself. To attribute to that, as GitHub is a public domain, others may contribute as well. Depending on how it goes, this project may also go fully Open Source under the GPL.
