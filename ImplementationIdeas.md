Layout Creator - Scripted/Conditional Constructs

IF Statement
- Implicitly set to "this" instance
    + Can explicitly be set using the "With" operator
- Obtains the possible conditionals for the set object (defined by the instance of the class).
    + Displays all conditionals in a dropdown spinner
AND Statement
- Used to join two or more conditionals into one.
    + Can only be used with the current reference
OR Statement
- Used to join two or more conditionals into one.
    + Also can only be used with the current reference.
THEN Statement
- Proceeds the IF statement
    + With the conditional, if it is true, this statement will be executed
    + Lists the next possible statements
WITH Statement
- Obtains a list of references/components currently available in a spinner
    + User may select one of these which will allow them to get the next possible statements
DO Statement
- Perform an action on the currently scoped reference
    + List of actions defined by the reference.
ELSE_IF Statement
- Executes this chain if the preceeding IF and ELSE_IF statement is false.
ELSE Statement
- Executes this chain if all preceeding IF and ELSE_IF statements are false
FOR Statement
- Executes the proceeding statement for a set amount of time, may be infinite or finite.

Types of Constructs
- Statements
    + Control-flow statements
        * IF, ELSE, etc.
- Conditionals
    + Scope-based and Context-based conditionals
- Action
    + Actions performed on references and variables in the current scope.
- Reference
    + Refers to a Component currently in the layout.
        * Defines it's own actions, conditionals, etc.
- Local Variable
    + Variables used to store information locally.
- Global Variable
    + Variables used to store information globally.

Script-Helper Menu
- Brings up possible options based on scope and context.
    + I.E, will show the currently usable Statements, Conditionals, Actions, etc.
- Should be smart enough to parse possible options as quickly as possible.


Pseudocode Example
[] -> Conditional
() -> Action
{} -> Reference
(::) -> Setter Action
? -> User input
: -> Function call, comma separated

When Button1 is clicked, it will execute the user defined instructions. Anything shown in any brackets will be obtained through the script-helper menu. Hence, the user has to only type the source String. Should only take about 15 seconds in reality if they copy paste.

Button1.onClick
    IF {ImageView1}[isVisible]
        {ImageView1}(setVisible::false)
    ELSE
        {ImageView1}(setSource:"https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png")
